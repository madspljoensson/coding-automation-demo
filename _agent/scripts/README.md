# Scripts

This folder contains scripts generated by the AI agent (`_agent/scripts/`).

## Structure

- **pending/** - Scripts created by the agent, awaiting human approval via PR
- **executed/** - Scripts that have been approved and run
- **templates/** - Reusable script patterns the agent can reference

## Lifecycle

1. Agent creates script in `pending/`
2. Agent opens PR for review
3. Human reviews and merges PR
4. `execute-approved.yml` workflow runs the script
5. Script is moved to `executed/`

## Writing Templates

Templates should be:
- Parameterized (no hardcoded values)
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Well-commented
- Include error handling
